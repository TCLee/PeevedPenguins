#Peeved Penguins

Peeved Penguins is a simple physics-based 2D game that is built using [SpriteBuilder](http://www.spritebuilder.com) game development tool. SpriteBuilder allows game developers and designers to rapidly prototype and iterate on a game.

This demo project is based on the tutorial at [MakeGamesWith.Us](https://www.makegameswith.us/tutorials/getting-started-with-spritebuilder/) with some additional code modifications of my own.

####How to Play
Just drag the catapult back to launch a penguin at the seals!
